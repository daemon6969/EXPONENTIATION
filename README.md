# Find the exponentiation of a number

## AIM:
To write a program to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Get the input from the user.
2. Use exponentiation operator to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Program:
```python
#Program to to find the Exponentiation of a number.
#Developed by: S.E.Elamaran
#RegisterNumber: 22000420
a=int(input()) 
b=int(input()) 
c=a**b
print('Exponentiation of a given number:',c) 

```

## Output:
![exponentiation of a number](4d.png)


## Result:
Thus the program to find the exponentiation of a given number is written and verified using python programming.
